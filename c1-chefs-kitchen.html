      My first thoughts after watching some of Shereef's video: F!@#* YEAH
    </p>
    <p>Part of the reason I was drawn to devbootcamp to begin with was the idea that part of its mission seemed to be about giving people the power to take control of thier lives, and that is exactly what the kitchen mindset is about. You are there cooking things up making things happen. Key words being cooking, you gotta stick with the metaphor, and making -- you have to be engaged. I am incredibly stoked to see what my devbootcamp experience has in store for me, and now I'm just excited to see what I myself will bring to the table. Table. That time I wasn't even trying to stick with the cooking metaphor.

Am I nervous. YES. Very much so, but it's transformed itself into the good kind of nervous. Like when you are on a roller coaster and you feel like an idiot because WHY DO YOU NEED TO DEFY MORTALITY, but at the same time you feel untouchable because human beings built these insane fear contraptions that let you soar through the sky and still be alive.
