SO... Margins. Look. We need to talk about them. Don't roll your eyes, these are important. Now, don't be like me and assume that Margins is some kind of hybrid of the words Marge(a la The Simpsons) and the word "in". The truth isn't that complicated. Margins are essentially the space between elements. Let's think metaphorically for a second-- let's say your web page is a pool, and that your elements are various objects floating in that pool. You've got a floatation device, maybe a pool noodle, and hey look there are even some trunks floating in there too because some kid decided that a pool party was the best place to start living his clothes optional lifestyle. Now all those objects (elements) are there in that pool (your page) the space in between them are your margins. Boom!

 This next one might trip you up a bit but stay with me here please. Borders are, the bordering around an element. Some elements have very clear borders-- again to think metaphorically it would be like the framing of a photograph, where the photo is the element and the frame is the border. Other borders may not be visible, but take my word for it, they are there! These are useful in design (a border can help with the theme of your site) and in positioning, as clear borders makes the visualization of what you are trying to move simpler.

Padding may be a little more on the confusing side, but I'm here to take that confusion and throw it into a volcano. Because volcanos have magma, and magma melts stuff? I'm melting your confusion! PADDING -- is the space between your content and it's bordering. Back to metaphors! Remember how I cleverly used a picture and its frame to describe bordering? Well now imagine you have the same frame but you've got a tiny picture instead that doesn't really fit. Have you seen something like that? Where the picture is inside the frame but because it's so small you can see the cork-like backing of the frame? Another example would be to think of a wall-a bulletin board-and then pictures on that bulletin board. The wall is your page. The frame of the bulletin board is your border and the picture inside the bulletin board is your content. Now the space between that picture and the frame of the bulletin board is... padding!! See.. confusion. Thrown into a volcano right? You're welcome.
