      Honestly no surprise there. As silly as it sounds sometimes I feel there's a lot of information inside my head, but it only ever wants to come out at random times and in strange ways. These strange ways usually involve me talking to somebody I know well, or when I am in an environment where I feel comfortable. As reluctant as I was to be prescribed a thinking style, I would say that the results were accurate. Is it like a horoscope situation though? Which is that phenomenon / urban legend where a classroom full of people are all given the same horoscope and each one of the people in that room agreed that that horoscope fit their personality, you know, because people are remarkably impossible to define. Except for this test, this test has me pretty much pegged. Working with people, and talking things out really helps me to solidify concepts, which is why the peer pairing is so great! Even if I do get nervous while pairing, I am the kind of person that allows myself to be vulnerable in order to open up lines of communication so that if there is something I am really not understanding I can talk it through with somebody else, and vise-a-versa giving somebody a piece of information that I know helps me to even feel calm in knowing that I know, which (semi) randomly reminded me of ontology and the difficulties there. Point is: knowing that I thrive in a group is good to know because I can push to pair more often and also try to get out of my shell as often as possible so as to meet and learn from people.

    <p>Besides some external factors, my biggest personal struggle is patience. Allowing myself time to acknowledge that I am stumped or confused as opposed to jumping to intense conclusions like “That's it, they are going to kick me out, I'm done before I even began, I don't know what I was thinking, etc.... etc..”. This very well could be related to the “random abstractness” of my mind which may want to jump all over the place instead of sitting for a minute. A plan of action I think would be to do whatever I know usually distracts me first a) do house chores first thing in the morning b) also go to the gym early so that my brain isn't constantly looking for an excuse to leave the house c) instead of walking away one thing I've been doing when i'm “stumped” is to take my pen and to just start drawing cartoons. This usually calms me down, and gives me a sense of creativity that I may possibly be able to bring to the table when it comes to solving whatever problem I am stuck on.

Expanding the way I think and grow. How would I go about doing that? Reading a book outside of the kind's of books I would normally read would probably be an interesting experiment. Because it's a book you wouldn't normally read it's also highly likely that you'll end up in the shoes of a teenager that falls in love with some kind of supernatural lochness monster man, okay maybe this isn't normally your bag, but you've just been exposed to something new, who knows what kind of neural pathways that created. Also, finding your comfort zone, and getting as far away from it as possible. Nothing interesting ever happened to the people who just stayed home (unless you count When a Stranger Calls styled). Something like finding intimidating looking challenges and doing what you can to solve them even if you think they are out of your skill level. That kind of mindset helps you to learn because you are putting yourself into the learner's seat.
