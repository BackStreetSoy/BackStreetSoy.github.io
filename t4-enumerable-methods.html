Hey folks, it's that time of the week again. For those of you that have been holding your breath for the entirety of the week I now release you from your self-imposed bondage. Guys, please don't not breath. No matter how excited you are to see what I've got to teach you guys this week, not breathing is a game where not only does nobody win, but it's also a game that commits the worst crime a game can commit: being lame. So before we even dive into the technical stuff let's all agree; not breathing is lame. Good, now let's actually talk about programming. Today we are going to talk about my favorite method that this specific blog post is about – group_by. 
    </p>
    <p>
 You may have noticed that there is something that makes the names of Ruby methods pretty handy and that is that if you are paying attention they tell you what function they perform. Taking that premise then let's look at the name of group_by. Because I believe that inside of your skull is a vibrant/beautiful mind I trust that just by looking at group_by you probably guessed that it's task is to take one thing (a collection) and group it by certain parameters that you have set, by using a block. The resulting group is done in the form of a hash. That's all well and good, but what does that look like? Well, my knowledge thirsty amigo, it looks like this: 

 <p> <code> (1..10).group_by {|i| i%2} #=> {0=>[2, 4, 6, 8, 10] 1=> [1, 2, 5, 7, 9]} </code></p>
    </p>

    <p>
Looking at the code written and going from left to right we have a range of 1 through 10, that are being grouped by the results of taking their remainders after being divided by 2. After that what we are given is a hash, where the key is the result of the block (that is the possible remainders) and the value is an array composed of the integers in that array that correspond to that remainder. What this means is that even integers like 2, 4, and 6 that have a remainder of 0 after being divided by 2 are place d in the array with 0 as it's key. Makes a massive load of sense right? And for the sake of me looking as thorough and competent as I can let me also tell you that you can have strings in your array as well. Let me show you how. 

<p><code> things_that_don't_exist_but_should = [“quick sand monster in a tutu”, “Ice Cream Gun”, “A machine that gives you back rubs and gold coins”]</code></p>

<p><code>things_that_don't_exist_but_should.group_by{|thing| thing.length} { 13 => [“Ice Cream Gun”] 28=>[“quick sand monster in a tutu”] 48=>[“A machine that gives you back rubs and gold coins”]}</code></p>
    </p>
    <p>
Now we're cooking. 

  As you can see the group_by method is one that is straight forward and can certainly come in handy, especially if you are dealing with a large pool of information (people in a phone book) that would be easier to deal with in smaller groups of your choosing.
