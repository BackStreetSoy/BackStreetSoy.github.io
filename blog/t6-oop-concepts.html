  <h1>Ruby Wars IV: A New Scope</h1>
  <h2>Not too long a time ago, on a kitchen table really, really, super close, like I'm sitting on it now....</h2>

    <p>
     The metaphorical galaxy is torn asunder as ruby code is being written with variables that are either far too accessible, like that friend you have that has absolutely no concept of boundaries and keeps telling you all of their secrets, or not accessible enough, like that friend of yours that won't listen to any of your secrets! Can order again be restored? Dude, of course it can. All you need to do is think about variable scope. 
    </p>
    <p>
     There are four different kinds of scope, and each will help in our aim to once again make the universe safe for those that follow the way of ruby. These four kinds of scope are local, global, instance, and class. Local variables, are kind of like people that never left their home towns, they stay right where they are. They remain local to the environment in which they were created. For instance if a local variable was written in a method, it could not be accessed outside of that method. Local are named with either an underscore or lower case letter at the beginning, which makes them pretty easy to spot. Global variables begin with a dollar sign ($). Is this a statement about how money is the international language? You tell me. Like money, global variables can be called anywhere within ruby code. Anywhere. Class variables and instance variables are similar in that they are variables that appear in classes. Class variables who have names that begin with @@, are accessible across classes, whereas instance variables, starting with a single @, are accessible only within a class. 
    </p>

    How can these variables possibly bring order? Well, they help keep all the bits and pieces of ruby where they need to be, or if you need help, you can even have variables swoop in and save the day! What makes ruby so beautiful is its flexibility and one way to maintain that flexibility is to manipulate the scope of the variables within your code. If ever you need hope, all you need is to look for the scope.
