       I'm just like you. I suffer from crippling night terrors wondering if I wake up tomorrow will the world still be the world, or will I be some kind of butler for a sentient computer that likes to watch animal cops. But I'm not someone that likes to live in fear, as my late great great Grandma once sent to me via telegram 'Jordan, stop, if you know longer want to fear something, stop, you must strive to understand it, stop, which is why I have decided to go to mardi gras this year'. I didn't see my great great grandmother again, but her lesson is something I will have with me forever; I have to understand the things that frighten me. So with that, I decided a philosophical argument about whether or not a program is capable of thinking would be both fun and would help calm my night terrors.

       Since the debate about whether or not computers and/or programs have the ability to think is extensive and is full of rabbit holes, I am going to focus this post on one particular argument known as 'The Chinese Room Argument'. I chose this argument because it's quite a lively thought experiment, and because I am a sucker for anything that sounds like it could be the title of a chapter in a pulp detective novel. The premise of the argument is essentially this, that just because programs are capable of producing intelligible output based on input/instructions given to it (namely our written code) it does not mean that the program itself understands what it happening and is mostly a mindless tool. This is demonstrated as so:

       Let's say you are for some reason be it boredom or deep seated resentment, you lock somebody into a room full of thousands and thousands of pens. The only access this person has to the outside world is a slot in the door that periodically spits out instructions with Chinese characters written on it that read like this “if the pattern is [chinese symbol], write 100001110010001001001 on the next empty line of the exercise book labelled 'input store'.” This poor dude then, based off another set of instructions, translates the 1's and 0's back into Chinese characters and puts the results through the part of the door labeled 'output slot'. The result is a perfectly intelligible response written in Chinese, but the guy doing all of that translating himself, wouldn't have gained any insight whatsoever to either Chinese  or even the bits of 1s and 0s. The argument is that the same can be said for programs. So just like the guy who you, for reasons that are your own, decided to lock away to decipher Chinese, a program does not necessarily require any knowledge, nor should knowledge be assumed just by the fact that it deciphers instructions given to it.

      It's an interesting thought. But like most thoughts, there is another thought that challenges it. There are thinkers on the other side of the thought camp that, while they are not ready to conclude whether or not programs can think, they believe the Chinese Room Argument is invalid. Their argument is that just because the guy in the room doesn't understand what is happening, it doesn't mean that the <em>larger process</em> of which he is a part, doesn't. A similar way to think about it (if your not a computer, are you a computer?) would be to think of a brain cell. A single brain cell is mostly responsible for taking in an electrical signal, and then releasing an electrical single of its own, it would be hard to say that a single brain cell itself thinks, but the <em>larger process</em> of which that braincell is part, i.e. a human being, is. At least, that's what we <em>think</em>.

      So where do you stand? Are our mechanical counterparts able to think? Is it even conceivable that they would be able to somewhere down the line? Will they dream of animal cops?
