  <h1>Wait, What's a Question?</h1>

      Let me begin this blog with a lame metaphor that I probably stole from somewhere else; questions are the keys to the doorway of knowledge. The problem though is that not all keys are created equal and that not all doors lead to useful knowledge. Example, let's say you are trying to figure out some differences between the syntax of Ruby and JavaScript, and instead of asking a more open question like, “What are some syntactical differences between Ruby and JavaScript?” you instead ask “Are there syntactical differences between Ruby and JavaScript?”. If you were to ask someone the later question that person would most likely just say “yes,” and then just stare at you in silence. So the key you used (i.e. your yes/no question) did lead in fact lead you through a knowledge door, but it was a tiny door with a really narrow piece of knowledge, that yes there is a syntactical difference between Ruby and JavaScript, but this doesn't really make you feel like you are any better off than you were before. So how can you walk through the right door? You need to ask the <em>right</em> questions.

    <p>
       So what is the right question? Boom. Right there, <em>that's</em> the right question. Why? Wow, another good question. You, my friend, are pretty good at this. A good question is one that requires more than just a one word response, these are narrow questions which will inspire narrow answers, to remedy this what you need to do is ask open questions, as open questions inspire open and more informative answers. Does that makes sense to you? Did you catch that? Or that? That was a series of narrow questions, I'm implementing what I'm teaching while I'm teaching it. Now I want you to take this time to think of me as an informational ninja. I won't deny it.

       Asking open questions is conveniently straightforward and can be achieved by focusing on these few operating words: Who, What, When, Where, and How. These are all open questions in that a 'yes' or a 'no' won't quite get the job done in terms of answering them, instead these questions tend to need a little more tender love and care, which is why you will get better quality answers and have better quality information available to you. Which is pretty groovy.

     When I looked at stack overflow I saw that some of the questions that got either no response, or dismissive responses had a few common characteristics. One of the characteristics was that the question was vague, instead of being succinct about what they needed, members would use flimsy language that erred on generality as opposed to the specificity of the problem. It's not totally surprising that this didn't really result in desirable answers as, and I think leads to a point about asking questions. If your question makes the person you are asking ask a question about the meaning of the question, then that original question probably wasn't the best, and most likely wasn't specific enough. Another problem I saw with some questions on stackoverflow was a lack of research being done. I found that this generates the most angry responses from community members, as they feel like the question is a waste of time and was unnecessary to ask since something very similar had already been dealt with. So, before you ask a question, it seems only wise to make sure nobody has already asked it. Right? Right.

      So,  my final question is what did you just learn?
