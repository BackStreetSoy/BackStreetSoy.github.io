  <h1>Stereotype This;</h1>
  <h2>Or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Found Out That Too Was Something to Worry About</h2>
  <h4>January 12, 2015</h4>

      I'm a six foot something two hundred pound mixed race male. My entire life has been peppered with people constantly trying to figure out “what I was”. When I was younger people were far less concerned with being politically correct and would ask me, point blank, “what are you?”, some of the more adventurous individuals would also pat my hair and ask me all sorts of questions about it.  Nowadays people will generally ask me if I mind if they ask me about my racial background, or will wait until it comes up organically. Racial identity, an ambiguous topic in and of itself, becomes even more ambiguous when you factor in having multiple racial identities. The plus side of this is that, when you realize how ambiguous it is at an early age, and when you see that people will actually try (and usually fail) to 'figure you out' by getting a read on your racial background, you comprehend it as a fools game. Being mixed I always felt like I was outside of the fray, and from my perspective the fray always seemed so clearly irrational. I used to feel untouchable, and sometimes I still do, but if my experience in college did anything, it shook my faith about my supposed 'untouchability'.

     I didn't go to high school in America. I went to international high schools that was a culturally diverse as the ocean is full of salt and weird fish with lightbulbs on their heads. It was like going to school in a utopian dream of a civil rights activist. That's actually not entirely true, but the schools were so diverse that it was pretty much expected that everyone around you was going to have a different world view from your own and you barely even thought about it. When it was time for me to go to college in the states, however, one of my very first experiences was all about race, and now that I think about it, kind of aggressively so. Like, the stereotype of America being race obsessed itself could not have been more strongly reenforced. It was during one of those orientation games that every college freshman ever  has had to play, it was a “guess who” game where we had to name tags posted on our backs and on those name tags were the names of famous people and we had to go around asking and answering questions to figure out what name tag was on our back. And, lo and behold, the only kind-of-sort-of-i-guess-maybe black seeming guy in the room (me) was labeled as Barack Obama and the only other black person in the room, that also happened to be a woman, what tag was put on her back? You might have guessed it, Michelle Obama. So right from the get-go I am literally being labeled. Awesome.

      So even if I don't necessarily see myself as necessarily black because in truth I am mixed, that doesn't mean I can control what stereotypes others may or may not put on me. Has this affected my achievement? After reading some articles on stereotype threat I can certainly admit that I can relate to having a chip on my shoulder when it comes to the need to not allow myself to be stereotyped, but it is hard to say how much of a role this played. Sometimes I think about it, and sometimes I don't. I think I think about it the most not in academic settings, but in social ones. I don't want to get too into it, but I was in a living situation once with people I considered to be good friends of mine but things deteriorated and resulted in my having a crisis of identity that to this day I still find myself struggling with, and one of the things that bothered me was never knowing how much race played a role in what happened. Maybe it didn't at all, but the fact that that is even a question I have to ask myself is disappointing.

      This blog-post is getting a little rambly rambly. End point, I focus on what I want to do and try my best not to evaluate it based off whether or not this makes me more or less of a stereotype, and think racism is – wait for how profound this is going to be – really really bad. Also stupid.
