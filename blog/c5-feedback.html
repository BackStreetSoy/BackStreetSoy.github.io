  <h1>I'm a Care Pair</h1>

I thoroughly enjoy peer-pairing. I'm always a little nervous in those few minutes right before I'm about to pair with someone because learning in front of other people can be a little embarrassing. A good analogy would be that you are learning to play the guitar and decided to send a random invite out into the ether for anybody else to show up and play the guitar with you, only you know that you aren't really that great and the person coming over may be slash in comparison to you. The plus side of this scenario though is that now you've got slash at your house and you can ask for some pointers. When this happens I typically feel like I don't have anything to offer in return so I just generally try to be good spirited, if I can't help out I'd at least like to be a joy to be around. When you find a partner that you mesh with though, boom, everybody step back because magic is about to happen. It feels great. Communication is smooth, moving through the challenge becomes simpler as we can talk our way through each step and even if we wind up somewhat at a loss we are at least lost together. Pairing can be difficult when you feel like energy levels aren't being matched, I find it not useful to try to push people out of their comfort zones if they don't want to be, but at the same time pairing becomes difficult when you feel resistance either in yourself or on the part of your partner.

     As for reading the feedback. The narcissist in me is pretty into it, you know the part of you that sometimes wishes it knew what everybody else was thinking? Even though you know that's one of the worst ideas ever, if you don't believe me there's a Family Matters episode where Urkel is granted this power and hi jinx ensues!  Obligatory Family Matters mention aside, what is nice about the feedback is that it says right there, in plain english what you are doing well and what you can work on. That's the ideal situation! Because it is actionable and specific it makes it so much easier to know how to approach a situation.

If I want to improve anything when it comes to my pairing, I'd say that I'd just like to strengthen my own knowledge so that I am bringing more to the table. I'm confident in my ability to communicate, but if I don't work more on the technical side of things, then all I'll be communicating is how not useful I am as I try to crack jokes, because if you are funny people will forgive you of your shortcomings! <em>wink</em>
