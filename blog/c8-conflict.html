  <h1>Conflict Analysis</h1>
  <h2><!--wrwe--></h2>
  <h4>January 25, 2015</h4>

    <p>
       The last conflict I remember was between a friend and I and it was over a sensitive topic so it turning into a conflict I suppose, isn't too surprising, as there is a reason why people stray away from talking about certain issues. I am particularly sensitive to scenarios when I perceive that people make statements that generalize any group of people. In this specific scenario a friend of mine had made a comment that I perceived as somewhat prejudiced, and I told him so, and the conversation only got heated and I ended up in a shouting match.  
    </p>
    <p>
       In situations like these I experience a wealth of emotions. There's anger, frustration, a little confusion, and, when I end up shouting, embarrassment. When people make statements that I view as stereotyping or generalizing I take it to heart because it makes me think of all the different ways that I could be stereotyped and how these kind of beliefs people hold affect so many lives. So really in the end, I suppose there is also a level of selfishness to it, in that I take comments like that as if they were directed at me. After this shouting match things became somewhat strained between my friend and I as we both felt awkward around each other for awhile, and my friend said that he was afraid to say anything else that might offend me. Obviously a strained relationship like that isn't an ideal scenario for anybody.  
    </p>
    <p>
       I eventually ended up apologizing to my friend, and explained to him why, certain comments get to me, and admitted that it was wrong of me to shout. And it was. Yelling to make a point doesn't make your point any clearer, nor does it make your perspective any more right, what it does is make you louder. I think an important part of conflict resolution is to develop the ability to lay your cards down onto the table, which means allowing yourself to both clearly express what it is that bothers you and to be able to admit when you are wrong. While these things are not guaranteed to solve every problem, they are still very strong tools.

      If I could do it again, it goes without saying that I would probably not have shouted and put more effort into end the conversation more civilly. The approach I try to adopt more often is to not argue while I am angry, as anger is shown to shut down your reason and rarely ends the way that you want it to. That being said, it's also not wise to bottle up anger, so I would say instead one should strive to express anger as opposed to express angrily.
