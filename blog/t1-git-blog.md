And Thus Begins My Adventures; Blog Post 1
An English Major's Dance with, like, Computers and Stuff

November 27, 2014 

So this is me, Jordan Obey, talking to you, imaginary audience of like minded peers who also don't know much about web development but will trust me because I'm just like you -- totally out of the loop. For now. As my powers grow and I transform into a Web Developing super-titan I will share what I have learned with you, you baby faced innocent ones. Let's begin. 

What are the benefits of version control? Oh boy. Where do I even begin? Probably with a definition of version control. Version control is about keeping track of your files and notes the changes you make and when you make them. Pretty niffty. It's like Big Brother for your code, only not dystopian (right?), and George Orwell isn't involved (right?). Instead it's like Big Brother for code in a non world-is-no-more kind of way, because it PROMOTES TEAM WORK! What? When you have a lot of people working on one project you leave room for chances for the dark specter of chaos to descend upon you. But with version control that not a problem, it allows your teammates to see what changes you have made and allows you to see what changes they have made. Cooperation is a two-way street and version control... controls that. 

Git is version control software. If you are like the way I was the only word in that sentence that made any sense was "is". But hey, relax, you know more than you think. In the previous well written and extraordinarily captivating paragraph I defined version control. Remember? It's what is used to keep track of files and the changes you make to those files. So when I say 'git is version control software', what I am saying is that git is software that keeps track of your files and the changes you make to them. To be clear git focuses on saving and noting changes LOCALLY, as in just on your computer. To get into sharing your changes with a team we'd have to talk about, wait for it, GITHUB. 

GITHUB is a way for you to store your saved changes so you can show your friends via the all knowing lord of all known knowledge: The Internet. Github is social. You want to use it so that you can become like a web-development version of Voltron -- your seperate pieces all coming together for the common sake of being incredible.
