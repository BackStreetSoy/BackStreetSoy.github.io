  <h1>Values, I Got 'Em</h1>
  <h2><!--wrwe--></h2>

       Self-respect is a value I treasure for two reasons. For starters self-respect provides the nourishment which allows other values to grow. Self-respect can ease the spirit and provide the sort of mental clarity that makes it possible for you to practice other values that you find important. The reason for this is simple, if you respect yourself you're not wasting mental energy by being at war with yourself. This comes from personal experience. I definitely know what it's like to live with a little mean spirited gremlin inside your head that has nothing better to do but just constantly remind you of all the reasons why you are no good and to utterly deflate you every chance it gets. The effort to stave off that little dude is exhausting, especially if you are trying to accomplish something free from the distraction of the gremlin. The antidote to gremlin-itis is self respect, as once you respect yourself the gremlin can no longer bother you, and once the gremlin is no longer bothering you, you suddenly have the energy to  do other things besides fight that guy.

       The other cool thing about self-respect is that you rely a lot less on others to provide you with the respect you lacked for yourself. What does that mean? It means that you have a lot more inner durability. Why? Because now every time you mess up or somebody corrects you or criticizes you you don't go into a defense mode, you instead listen and see if the feedback is something you can utilize, and if not? Well then you just nod your head, smile, and move on with your life.

       Advice – A while back I was actually once asked to be a 'mentor' to somebody. I don't really know why, I think it was a mix of me at the time being really loud all the time and acting a lot like I knew what I was doing when really I pretty much made everything up as I went along. The only part of that that has changed is that I'm not as loud as I used to be. I think what it comes down to though is that I am someone that has decidedly made a point to celebrate life. So what value is that? Vibrancy? So what I believe this person sensed was my “okay life-- come at me” attitude that I tried to culminate. The advice I ended up giving to him though essentially boiled down to “hey, I have no idea what I'm doing and I'm pretty sure most other people don't either”. I don't think he wanted my advice ever again.

      Stereotype Threat – Honestly just being aware of stereotype threat has already helped me. It's that old idea that once you understand something it doesn't frighten you as much anymore, like when you hear about people that will read about how airplanes work because they are terrified of flying. Actually, maybe I should do that. In terms of exercises I could do if I feel particularly out of whack while I am at  dev bootcamp, I'd say the biggest thing for me would be to SLOW DOWN. Often it happens that when I feel uncomfortable I want that situation to go away as fast as possible – I believe it's the old ripping the bandaid off the wound strategy – here's the thing though it actually hurts a lot less to take that band aid off slowly and likewise it is easier to process emotions when you slow yourself down. Instead of bulldozing through a problem like some kind of emotionally unstable bulldozing maniac with an eye patch, try instead to walk through the problem and your thoughts slowly like instead you are not whatever weird cartoon villain I just made up.
