It is telling to me when the first listed result from a google search of “problems in technology” is an article about the sexism and general lack of diversity in the tech industry. For a field whose basic ethos has always come across to me as the ethic of progress – for technology at its best strives to inspire and enhance that ever present kindling inside of us that we have come to describe as our human spirit – it is troubling that even here we find the oh too familiar failings of prejudice and exclusionary attitudes.

I am coming at this problem with a few different lenses, the two most prominent being my perspective as a “newbie” on the fringes of tech culture watching as an outsider, and as someone who is racially mixed (African American and Palestinian). From this standpoint it is already clear how an article about both women and minority groups are not only underrepresented in technology but that it is known that there is a culture that exists in the tech field that drives members of those groups away from these fields, can negatively impact the tech community. For starters before even beginning a career in tech, I already feel somewhat apprehensive, and I am certain other people new to the field reading something like that would feel similarly. To go into a situation not only feeling like an outsider but to also fear that you may be treated as an outsider regardless of earned credentials is not exactly the kind of thing people wake up in the morning just sort of in the mood to do. Who would want that? “Hey, you know what? Today I feel like going into an industry that marginalizes my particular demographic and has been known to send people like me running like foxes being tracked by hounds. Yup. That sounds like a good time.” The answer is no one.

Even without the threat of exclusionary “brogrammer” attitudes driving away potential employees it should also just be emphasized that, sexism is and any other form of prejudice fueled “ism” is an embarrassing failure for anyone that likes to think of themselves as a just participant in society. Unless you don't like thinking of yourself as just, in which case by all means go right ahead and be as sexist and racist as your heart desires slim. Those of us with our heads on right will sit back in awe at the irony of someone in a forward thinking industry who prefers to do his thinking backwards.

I don't know if there is a single solution to something like this, but the more comprehension that members of the tech community have of the issues at hand the less problems like these will arise. I am someone that believes in the idea of big changes are only truly possible as a result of smaller changes. After all, a community is only the sum of the members of the community, so if we want to change the attitudes of a community the members of that community will need to honestly examine their own attitudes. The question now then is how do we go about encouraging introspection? Communication seems like a good start. Obviously introspection can't be forced nor measured, but if we start having a  genuine discussion, genuine emotion can then be pulled from that, and once empathy begins to play a role, that is when we start seeing the changes the kind of micro changes that can result in the profound changes on the macro level. </p>
