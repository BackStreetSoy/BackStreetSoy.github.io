  <h1>JavaScript vs Ruby</h1>

       While there are quite a few differences between Ruby and JavaScript, for this blog I'd like to talk about the differences between my learning experiences with the two of them, primarily because I think it is a testament to my progress during phase-0.

       My first experiences with Ruby weren't necessarily terrible but it definitely involved more than a few times of my eyes growing wide as my brain edged close to short-circuiting. Actual sparks shot out of my ears at one point. But because of my initial struggles with Ruby and the effort I put into understanding the concepts, it made my initial adventures (in the case of code combat the term adventure is pretty spot on) into JavaScript so much easier, which was a relief, because I was scared that it would feel a lot like starting from scratch again. But going into JavaScript already being familiar with basic programming concepts and vocabulary (like arrays, strings, functions, etc..) made the process much smoother. There are some things that did bother me about JavaScript going into it though.

      I still need to solidify when to use the semi-colons (;) and when to use the commas (,). They were a little frustrating to get acquainted with, because in Ruby they weren't necessary. Ruby also doesn't require as many brackets and has nice 'end' key-words. So in terms of aesthetics, Ruby is definitely the winner. It is simply a prettier language than javascript. I also found it kind of odd that you had to specify to javaScript that something is a variable by writing 'var' before hand. I also was not a fan of the notation used to create functions which seemed very involved compared to Ruby's use of the 'def' keyword. None of these are really issues, these are just the woes of somebody that just got used to one way of doing something only to get used to doing the same kind of things but in a different way.
