1. One of the challenges I discovered while going through this material was that I kept finding myself worrying about whether or not I'd be able to memorize everything. My mind tends to want to rush through things instead of slowing down and being patient. I was able to calm myself down and work through it however, and will continue to drill them.
2. The only command that I wasn't able to use successfully was the “dir -r” command. I tried it multiple times but didn't yield any results. That was a bummer, but I will look into it further in order to smooth it out. 

1. pwd – print working directory
2. ls – list files and folders
3. grep – find things inside of files 
4. mv – move a file / directory 
5. cd – change directory 
6. ../ – go “up” one directory 
7. touch – create an empty file 
8. mkdir – makes a directory 
9. echo – prints arguments 
10.  less – page through a file 
11. rmdir – remove a directory 
12. cat – print whole file 
13. rm – remove file or directory 
14. exit – leave the terminal 
15. help – offers help
