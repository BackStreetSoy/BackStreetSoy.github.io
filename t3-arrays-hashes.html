  <h1>Arrays vs Hashes</h1>
  <h2>The Battle of the Century That Nobody Won Because Violence Isn't The Answer Guys</h2>

    <p>
      In this technical blog, I am going to layeth down some programming knowledge medieval style, so whip out your scrolls of parchment and take notes with your quills.
    </p>
    <p>So to begin with I am going to talk about arrays, because alphabetically they would come first, and because they are only two letters away from being arrows, which I'm going to take as not a coincidence and just say it probably means something relevant (I looked into it: it doesn't). Now, what are arrays? Let's do what programmers do and break that question into parts. A) “What”-- pronoun; used typically when asking for information or specifying a thing. B) “are arrays?” – The thing that needs to be specified. What are arrays? Great question! Arrays are containers of things (in this case objects, like strings and integers) that are organized in order from first to last. Another way to say it is that an array is like a programming treasure chest, where the treasure is information (instead of worthless doubloons). Now these arrays/containers/programming treasure chests are typically assigned to a variable. Now when we think of potential Array variables, I think there is an example that pops into all our heads, body_parts. Now with the cliché variable choice of body_parts I guess we'll also have to make the array be made up of cliché strings. Let's do it:
<code>
body_parts = [“left thumb toe”, “uvula”, “glottis”, “canine tooth”]
</code>
</p>

    <p>
      Now, ignoring my obvious oral fixation, that's a pretty sweet array. But we don't know how to access anything from it, and without being able to access anything from an array it's about as useful as eating a hot lump of ham at a public pool while also wearing a sweater with the terrible pun “Doof Jam Records” written on it. You'll be sweaty, smell like ham, and nobody will like you. To amend that situation here is what you do → <code>body_parts [1] #=> uvula </code>. The reason we wrote 1 instead of 2 (which you might be tempted to do) is because Arrays are listed on a cardinal index. No, that doesn't mean it's listed on a high ranking catholic index, and it definitely doesn't mean its a sort of index for a specific breed of bird (I checked my sources twice to be sure), all it means is that we start our index at 0 instead of 1 (so we can pick our elements at random, despite order), trust me, I'm learning programming, so, like, I know enough to tell you that I am told that this is useful (it makes doing math on these things easier). So that is my basic crash course on Arrays. Next up we have hashes.
    </p>

    <p>Hashes as defined by the ruby-doc are – wait, can I just stop to ask if anybody else thinks of the Ruby-doc as “The Ruby Doctor?” (look out here comes me, the Ruby Doctor! Diagnosis: Not enough knowledge about the rubez, diagnosis? Me!) – anyways the ruby-doc defines a hash a 'dictionary like collection of unique keys and their values'. So, what the take away is here is that hashes are similar to arrays (they are containers of information), but instead of having each element be paired with an index value, you get to pair it with WHATEVER YOU WANT. Freedom, smell it, it's not unlike barbecue sauce right? Let's do a hash that holds time of day as a key and the food you would eat during that time as a value because I'm hungry:

      <code>Food_time = {morning: “bacon”, after_noon: “burgers and bacon”, dinner: “Meatloaf and bacon”} </code>

    </p>

    <p> So if we typed <code>food_time[morning]</code>, we'd get... BACON. There we go. Bacon is great, and hashes afford freedom and are useful if you want to do things like create databases. Have a good day. </p>
